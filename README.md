### SlickNav ###

The menu uses [SlickNav by ComputerWolf](https://github.com/ComputerWolf/SlickNav). You can safely remove any reference of SlickNav from `style.scss` and `./scripts/app.js`. Be sure to minimize the file again afterwards.

## Notes & Remarks ##

I've never really committed much to GitHub before, so pardon me if things are a bit weird or incomplete. This project is a way for me to teach and learn at the same time so if you have any remarks please submit a pull request with improvements and/or drop a comment or issue.
