# CHANGELOG #

## version 0.0.1 ##

initial release. This is in no way a finished or perfectly tested version. In fact, I know not all elements are displayed properly yet.

### New files in this version ###

* `./index.html`
* `./partials/_elements.scss`
* `./partials/_images.scss`
* `./partials/_reset.scss`
* `./partials/_tables.scss`
* `./partials/_typography.scss`
* `./css/style.css` (automatically parsed from `./css/style.scss`)
* `./css/style.scss`
* `./css/theme.scss`
* `./scripts/app.js`
* `./scripts/app.min.js` (automatically parsed from `./scripts/app.js`)

### SlickNav ###

The menu uses [SlickNav by ComputerWolf](https://github.com/ComputerWolf/SlickNav). You can safely remove any reference of SlickNav from `style.scss` and `./scripts/app.js`. Be sure to minimize the file again afterwards.

## Notes & Remarks ##

I've never really committed much to GitHub before, so pardon me if things are a bit weird or incomplete. This project is a way for me to teach and learn at the same time so if you have any remarks please submit a pull request with improvements and/or drop a comment or issue.
